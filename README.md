Damage calculator for **Neverwinter Nights** game.

# How To Use?
Before you run the script with `python damage_calculator.py` command, you may want to set some values to reflect the damage calculation of weapon of your choice against customized target.
Please see the below.

**Note:** Once you run the script, it may take a while to calculate the damage averages based on targeted ac list and round count.

---

**Total Rounds**

To set the total rounds, you need to find this line and change the number with the rounds you want the calculate average damage:
```python
ROUNDS = 500000
```
Do not forget, you do attacks as much as your **APR** in a round so this script would run simulation of 3 million attacks if 500000 given as value. 
Increased number of rounds would increase the correctness of average data but it would also increase the calculation time. IMO, 500000 is good value.

**Weapon Properties**

To set the values related to **weapon**, you need to find this line: *(See the comments on the code for detailed description)*
```python
WEAPON = {
    "name"                : "GMW Naginata", # Weapon name. Just a display thing.
    
    "damage"              : "1d10",         # Weapon's damage dice. If your weapon got 2d4 dice, set it as 2d4.
    
    "damage_bonus"        : 5 + 21,         # Damage bonus added on top of the weapon's damage. In this example, 5 comes from
                                            # GMW scroll and 21 is the STR modifier of the character. Total of 26 damage bonus.
                                            
    "threat_range"        : 19,             # Threat range of weapon. You must take Improved Critical feat into considiration.
                                            # Naginata normally has 20 threat range. But with Improved Critical feat, it 
                                            # becomes 19.
                                            
    "crit_multiplier"     : 2,              # Critical Multiplier of the weapon. If you have a feat that increases your
                                            # Critical Multiplier, you must take it into considiration. For example,
                                            # if you were an WM with 5 or more levels, due to Increased multiplier
                                            # feat that WM gains at level 5, Critical Multiplier of Naginata would be 3.
                                            # So you would need to give 3 as a value in that case.
                                            
    "other_damage_bonus"  : [               # This is the other damage bonus list. What I mean from other damage bonus is item 
                                            # or class related bonuses. Like temporary essence or Hexblade's curse weapon ability. 
                                            # "name" is just a display thing. "damage" is the damage that will be dealt to target. 
                                            # Do not forget to write dice value as string. Such as "1d6". If it is not a dice value
                                            # but instead a direct value, write it as integer. Such as 2. (See below) If you set
                                            # "resistable" to False, defensive essences' of your attack target won't apply to this
                                            # damage type. For example Hexblade's damage bonuses from curse weapon ability can't be 
                                            # resisted by defensive essences.
        {"name" : "Divine", "damage" : "1d6", "resistable" : True},
        {"name" : "Positive", "damage" : 2, "resistable" : False},
        {"name" : "Negative", "damage" : 2, "resistable" : False}
    ],
    "massive_crit"        : None            # Weapon's Massive Critical property dice. Can either be a value or a dice. 
                                            # For example 3 or "2d4".
}
```

**Character Properties**

To set the values related your **character**, you need to find this line: (See the comments on the code for detailed description)

```python
CHARACTER = {
    "ab"                    : 50,    # Your first attack's AB. Which is your highest AB. If you are dual-wielding, you need to 
                                     # take it into considiration.
                                     
    "base_apr"              : 6,     # Your BASE APR. Do not count dual-wield APR bonus and APR bonuses from spells like Haste.
                                     # This example's character is monk thus it got 6 APR with monk proficiency weapon (naginata).
                                     
    "dual_wielding"         : False, # If set to True, your APR will be increased by 2 and dual-wielding will taken into account
                                     # when doing calculations.
                                     
    "extra_attack"          : 1,     # Your extra attack bonus from spells like haste and abilities like blinding speed, etc.
                                     # NOTE: If your character have Thundering Rage, it's bonus APR will not be taken into account
                                     # even if you set "thundering_rage" at below to True. Setting it to True only affects
                                     # bonus damage on critical hits. You need to increase "extra_attack" count by 1 in this case.
                                     # For example let's assume you are a barbarian with haste and thundering rage active. Then you
                                     # would have 2 extra attacks and you should have set this "extra_attack" field to 2.
                                     # This example's character is a monk with haste thus I have set this "extra_attack" field to 1.
    
    "overwhelming_critical" : False, # If set to True, it's extra damage on critical hits will be taken into account
                                     # when doing calculations.
                                     
    "thundering_rage"       : False, # If set to True, it's extra damage on critical hits will be taken into account

    "is_monk"               : True   # If set to True, AB penalty is set to -3 from -5 for consecutively attacks.
}
```

**Target Properties**

To set the values related your character's **target**, you need to find this line: (See the comments on the code for detailed description)

```python
TARGET = {
    "ac_list"           : [50, 55, 60, 65, 70], # This is the AC list that attacks will be made against. You can add or
                                                # remove values from this list. For example if you want to make your
                                                # attacks against 30, 35, 40 AC; you would need to set it as [30, 35, 40].
                                                # More AC in the list means increased calculation time.
                                                
    "defensive_essence" : 5,                    # Target's defensive essence value. This value will apply to all damage types that
                                                # is set as resistable. ("resistable" : True). And value of this field will be

    "concealment"       : 50,                   # Target's concealment value. This value may come from spell or abilities like

                                                # account when doing calculations.
                                                
    "physical_immunity" : 0,                    # Physical immunity value of the target. This value repsents a percentage (%).
                                                # For example, if this value was set to 25, calculations would be done as if
                                                # your target had 25% physical immunity.
                                                
    "physical_damage_reduction": 0              # Physical damage reduction value of the target. For example, if this value 
                                                # was set to 10, all of your character's physical damage dealt would be
                                                # reduced by 10.
}

# Arelith Combat Simulator GUI
This project brings a graphical user interface to the [Arelith Combat Simulator](https://github.com/egebilecen/arelith-combat-simulator). The project is based on [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and uses React for the user interface, with the utilization of [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) UI components. Since the combat simulator is rewritten in Rust, it is more efficient than the Python script (which can be found in the [old](https://github.com/egebilecen/arelith-combat-simulator-gui/tree/old) branch) in terms of speed. This GUI application also displays the combat simulation results in an interactive line chart using [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html).
